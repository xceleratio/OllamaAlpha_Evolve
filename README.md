# OpenAplha_Evolve: Regenerating Autonomous Algorithmic Discovery 🚀

**Unlock the power of Large Language Models and Evolutionary Computation to tackle complex algorithmic challenges!**

OpenAplha_Evolve is an open-source Python framework inspired by the groundbreaking research on autonomous coding agents like DeepMind's AlphaEvolve. It's a **regeneration** of the core idea: an intelligent system that iteratively writes, tests, and improves code using Large Language Models (LLMs) like Google's Gemini, guided by the principles of evolution.

## ✨ The Vision: AI-Driven Algorithmic Innovation

Imagine an agent that can:

*   Understand a complex problem description.
*   Generate initial algorithmic solutions.
*   Rigorously test its own code.
*   Learn from failures and successes.
*   Evolve increasingly sophisticated and efficient algorithms over time.

OpenAplha_Evolve is a step towards this vision. It's not just about generating code; it's about creating a system that *discovers* and *refines* solutions autonomously.

## 🧠 How It Works: The Evolutionary Cycle

OpenAplha_Evolve employs a modular, agent-based architecture to orchestrate an evolutionary process:

1.  **Task Definition**: You, the user, define the algorithmic "quest" – the problem to be solved, including examples of inputs and expected outputs.
2.  **Prompt Engineering (`PromptDesignerAgent`)**: This agent crafts intelligent prompts for the LLM. It designs:
    *   *Initial Prompts*: To generate the first set of candidate solutions.
    *   *Mutation Prompts*: To introduce variations and improvements to existing solutions.
    *   *Bug-Fix Prompts*: To guide the LLM in correcting errors from previous attempts.
3.  **Code Generation (`CodeGeneratorAgent`)**: Powered by an LLM (currently configured for Gemini), this agent takes the prompts and generates Python code.
4.  **Evaluation (`EvaluatorAgent`)**: The generated code is put to the test!
    *   *Syntax Check*: Is the code valid Python?
    *   *Execution*: The code is run against the input/output examples defined in the task.
    *   *Fitness Scoring*: Programs are scored based on correctness, efficiency (runtime), and other potential metrics.
5.  **Database (`DatabaseAgent`)**: All programs (code, fitness, generation, lineage) are stored, creating a record of the evolutionary history.
6.  **Selection (`SelectionControllerAgent`)**: The "survival of the fittest" principle in action. This agent selects:
    *   *Parents*: Promising programs from the current generation to produce offspring.
    *   *Survivors*: The best programs from both the current population and new offspring to advance to the next generation.
7.  **Iteration**: This cycle repeats for a defined number of generations, with each new generation aiming to produce better solutions than the last.
8.  **Orchestration (`TaskManagerAgent`)**: The maestro of the operation, coordinating all other agents and managing the overall evolutionary loop.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shyamsaktawat/OpenAplha_Evolve.git # MODIFIED URL
    cd OpenAplha_Evolve # MODIFIED directory name
    ```

3.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    *   Copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env`:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    *   Edit `.env` and add your `GEMINI_API_KEY`:

## 💡 Defining Your Own Algorithmic Quests!

Want to challenge OpenAplha_Evolve with a new problem? It's easy:

1.  **Open `main.py`**.
2.  **Modify the `TaskDefinition`**:
    *   `id`: A unique identifier for your task.
    *   `description`: A clear, detailed natural language description of the problem. This is crucial for the LLM to understand what to do.
    *   `function_name_to_evolve`: The name of the Python function the agent should try to create/evolve.
    *   `input_output_examples`: A list of dictionaries, each containing an `input` (what your function will receive) and the corresponding expected `output`. These are vital for evaluation.
        *   For complex inputs (like graphs), structure them as Python dictionaries or lists.
        *   Use `float('inf')` or `float('-inf')` directly for infinity values if needed by your problem.
    *   `allowed_imports`: Specify a list of Python standard libraries that the generated code is allowed to import (e.g., `["heapq", "math", "sys"]`).
    *   (Optional) `evaluation_criteria`: Define how success is measured (e.g., prioritize correctness, then minimize runtime).
    *   (Optional) `initial_code_prompt`: Provide a more specific starting prompt if the default isn't suitable.

3.  **Run the agent** as before.

The quality of your `description` and `input_output_examples` significantly impacts the agent's success!
